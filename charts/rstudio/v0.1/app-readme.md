# RStudio Server
RStudio Server enables you to provide a browser based interface to a version of 
R running on a remote Linux server, bringing the power and productivity of 
the RStudio IDE to server-based deployments of R.

## Authentication
When launching RStudio Server app, you need to fill rstudio password (username will always be: rstudio).

## Web Access
You also need to specify hostname of installed application. This hostname has to end with .dyn.cerit-sc.cz.
E.g. set rstudio-xhejtman.dyn.cerit-sc.cz to make sure this name is not used already.

Navigate your browser to the chosen hostname, e.g., https://rstudio-xhejtman.dyn.cerit-sc.cz.
