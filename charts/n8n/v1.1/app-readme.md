[n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/) (pronounced n-eight-n) helps you to connect any app with an API with any other, and manipulate its data with little or no code.

Customizable: highly flexible workflows and the option to build custom nodes.
Convenient: use the npm or Docker to try out n8n, or the Cloud hosting option if you want us to handle the infrastructure.
Privacy-focused: self-host n8n for privacy and security.

## Run

1. Enter your desired URL name (e.g., `n8n-my-namespace.dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz`).
2. Wait for the application to start.
3. Once running, navigate to the specified URL and log in filling mail and select password. Do not wait as the first registration is the admin user.

## AI Configuration
