# ParaView Server

ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization application. ParaView users can quickly build visualizations to analyze their data using qualitative and quantitative techniques. The data exploration can be done interactively in 3D or programmatically using ParaViewâ€™s batch processing capabilities.

This application runs ParaView server so that local ParaView client can connect to it.

# Access

When running, ParaView exposes port 11111 for client connection. See *Service Discovery* and *Services* for endpoint IP address. It is also possible to connect to the Pod via SSH on standard port 22, IP is the same as for the Client connection.
